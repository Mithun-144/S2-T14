## Abstract
<details>
  <summary>Key Takeaways</summary>
  
  1. **Motivation**:
  The inspiration for this project came from observing a gap in our campus food court services. Due to time constraints between classes, students often struggle with long wait timesfor their orders. While the food court was willing to offer a priority service for an additionalfee, there was no effective channel to facilitate this option. This project aims to bridge that gapby providing a platform where students can pay extra to receive their orders faster, enhancing
convenience and efficiency for both customers and the food court.

2. **Problem Statement**:
Priority Dine was created to solve this problem. It lets customers choose the order in
which their food is servedâ€”whether they want their drink first, their starter, or the main
course right away. This makes the dining experience more enjoyable for customers because
they can get their meal the way they prefer.
For hotel and restaurant owners, Priority Dine is also useful because it keeps track of all the
orders for the day. This helps owners know how much food is being ordered and can assist in
managing staff and supplies more efficiently. Overall, Priority Dine makes dining more flexible
for customers and more organized for businesses.

3. **Features**:
Priority Dine is a special service that helps people enjoy their food just the way they want.
We have three choices:
    1. **Priority Service**: If you want your food really fast, you can pay a little extra, and
it will come to you sooner.
    2. **Standard Service**: This is the regular way. You pay the normal price, and your food
comes when it usually does.
    3. **Discounted Service**: If your food takes too long, you get some money taken off your bill.

This way, everyone can choose how they want their food. It makes eating out more fun
and helps restaurants serve their customers better. Priority Dine helps make sure everyone is
happy when they eat!
